# SyllabusCrawler

SyllabusCrawler is part of a bachelor's degree course/thesis [DA362A](https://utbildningsinfo.mau.se/kurs/da362a/kursplan/20221) and we are two Information Architecture students who have contributed this code. The purpose is to aid the creation of syllabuses but can also be used for other information gathering things.

## Installation and running the app

Make sure that you have the current pip version installed.
In your terminal in your prefered code editor, type ```python``` and if that is not working use ```python3``` or ```python2```.

```bash Windows:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py 
```

```bash Mac:
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py 

If you get a urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1108), run this command: $ bash /Applications/Python*/Install\ Certificates.command
```

Your terminal will say ```Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/```, ```CTRL + CLICK``` on the address and the application will show up in your browser, or you can type it in and if it will not you can type the address in the addressbar in your preferred browser.
